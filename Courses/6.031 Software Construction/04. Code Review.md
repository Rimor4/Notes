- Fail fast
- Avoid magic numbers
- One purpose for each variable
- Use good names
- Use whitespace to help the reader
- Don’t use global variables
- Methods should return results, not print them
- Avoid special-case code
#### Comment
specifies the **provenance or source** of a piece of code that was copied or adapted from elsewhere
```java
// read a web page into a string
// see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4328711/read-url-to-string-in-few-lines-of-java-code
String mitHomepage = new Scanner(new URL("http://www.mit.edu").openStream(), "UTF-8").useDelimiter("\\A").next();
```
#### Don’t use global variables
[Global Variables Are Bad](https://wiki.c2.com/?GlobalVariablesAreBad)
- a ==_local variable_== inside a method
- an ==_instance variable_== inside an instance of an object
    - an instance variable may also be called a ==_field_== (particularly in Java), a ==_property_== (TypeScript/JavaScript), a ==_member variable_== (C++), or an ==_attribute_== (Python).
- a ==_static variable_== associated with a class
### Methods should return results, not print them
In general, only the **highest-level parts** of a program should interact with the human user or the console. **Lower-level parts** should take their input as <span style="background:#fff88f">parameters</span> and <span style="background:#fff88f">return</span> their output as results. The sole exception here is <font color="#ff0000">debugging output</font>, which can of course be printed to the console. But that kind of output shouldn’t be a part of your design, only a part of how you debug your design.
#### Avoid special-case code
**Actively resist the temptation to handle special cases separately.** If you find yourself writing an `if` statement for a special case, stop what you’re doing, and instead think harder about the general-case code, either to confirm that it can actually already handle the special case you’re worrying about (which is often true!), or put in a little more effort to make it handle the special case. If you haven’t even written the general-case code yet, but are just trying to deal with the easy cases first, then you’re doing it in the wrong order. **Tackle the general case first**.
