```java
public static <E> ImList<E> empty();
	/*
	The E in ImList<E> is a placeholder for the type of elements in an instance of ImList, but empty is a static method: it cannot see instance variables or methods, and it also cannot see the instance type parameter.
	 */
```

### Tuning the rep
We can make it better with a simple change to the rep of the list that **cache**s the size the first time we compute it, so that subsequently it costs only _O(1)_ time
[[11. Abstraction Functions & Rep Invariants#Beneficent mutation]]
```java
public class Cons<E> implements ImList<E> {
    private final E elt;
    private final ImList<E> rest;
    private int size = 0;
    // rep invariant:
    //   elt != null, rest != null, size >= 0
    //   size > 0 implies size == 1+rest.size()

    // ...
    public int size() { 
        if (size == 0) size = 1 + rest.size();
        return size;
    }
}
```

### Rep independence and rep exposure revisited
Any time you write an ADT, its specs must **not talk about the rep**. The concrete variants of a recursive ADT are its rep, so the specs must not mention them.

### Null vs. empty
Using an object, rather than a null reference, to signal the base case or endpoint of a data structure is an example of a design pattern called ==_sentinel objects_==
Keep `null` values out of your data structures, and your life will be happier.

### Backtracking search with immutability
避免不变类型中的回溯
But immutable data structures with no **sharing** aren’t a great idea either, because the space you need to keep track of where you are (in the case of the satisfiability problem, the environment) will grow <font color="#ff0000">quadratically</font> if you have to make a complete copy every time you take a new step. You need to **hold on to all the previous environments on your path**, in case you need to back up.

  
**Immutable lists** have the nice property that each step taken on the path can share all the information from the previous steps, just by <span style="background:#b1ffff">adding to the front of the list</span>.
