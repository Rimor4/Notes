### What to assert

Here are some things you should assert:

- **Method argument requirements**, like we saw for `sqrt`

- **Method return value requirements.** This kind of assertion is sometimes called a _==self check==_. For example, the `sqrt` method might square its result to check whether it is reasonably close to x:

避免忘记一些**invariants**

```java
public double sqrt(double x) {
	assert x >= 0;     
	double r;     
	... // compute result r    
	assert Math.abs(r*r - x) < .0001;    
	return r; 
	}
```

### What not to assert
- Never use assertions to test **conditions that are external to your program**, such as the existence of files, the availability of the network, or the correctness of input typed by a human user. Assertions test the <font color="#ffff00">internal</font> <font color="#ffff00">state</font> of your program to ensure that it is within the bounds of its specification. （**External failures** should be handled using exceptions instead, like `FileNotFoundException` or `NoRouteToHostException`.）
- 
```java
// don't do this:
assert list.remove(x);
```

<font color="#ff0000">If assertions are disabled, the entire expression is skipped</font>, and `x` is never removed from the list. Write it like this instead:

`boolean found = list.remove(x); assert found;`

Similarly, if a conditional statement or `switch` does not cover all the possible cases, it is good practice to use a check to block the illegal cases. But don’t use the `assert` statement here, because it can be turned off. Instead, throw an exception in the illegal cases, so that the check will always happen:

```java
switch (vowel) {   
	case 'a':   
	case 'e':   
	case 'i':   
	case 'o':   
	case 'u': return "A";   
	default: throw new AssertionError("must be a vowel, but was: " + vowel);
}
```

### Modularity & encapsulation
- **Minimizing the scope of variables**
- **Avoid global variables**
