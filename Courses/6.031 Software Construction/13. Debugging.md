 A good rule of thumb is the **10-minute rule**. If you’ve spent 10 minutes hunting for a bug using ad hoc, unsystematic inspection, then it’s time to take a step back and start applying the scientific method instead.
 
### 1. Study the data
One important form of data is the stack trace from an exception.
### 2. Hypothesize
### 3. Experiment
#### Don’t fix yet
It’s tempting to try to do an experiment that seems to _fix_ the hypothesized bug, instead of a mere probe. This is almost always the wrong thing to do. First, it leads to a kind of ad hoc guess-and-test programming, which produces awful, complex, hard-to-understand code. Second, your fix may just mask the true bug without actually removing it — treating the symptom rather than the disease.
### 4. Repeat
#### Keep an audit trail
  
Keep a log in a text file of what you did, in what order, and what happened as a result. Include:

- the **hypothesis** you are exploring now
- the **experiment** you are trying now to test that hypothesis
- what you observe as a result of the experiment:
    - whether the test passed or failed this time
    - the program output, especially your own debugging messages
    - any stack traces


### Fix the bug 
**Look for related bugs, and newly-created ones.**
**Undo debugging probes.**
**Make a regression test.**
