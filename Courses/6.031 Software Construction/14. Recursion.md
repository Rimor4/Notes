### Mutual recursion
Static variables and aliases to mutable data are very unsafe for recursion, and lead to insidious bugs like this. When you’re implementing recursion, the safest course is to **pass in the values it needs**, and stick to **immutable objects or avoid mutation**.
### When to use recursion rather than iteration
Another reason to use recursion is to take more advantage of immutability. In an ideal recursive implementation, all variables are **final**, all data are **immutable**, and the recursive methods are all **pure functions** in the sense that they do not mutate anything.
### Common mistakes in recursive implementations

Here are three common ways that a recursive implementation can go wrong:

- The base case is missing entirely, or the problem needs more than one base case but **not all the base cases are covered**.
- The recursive step doesn’t reduce to a **smaller subproblem**, so the recursion doesn’t converge.
- **Aliases** to a mutable data structure are inadvertently shared, and mutated, among the recursive calls.
