### Input handling in a graphical user interface
```java
JButton playButton = new JButton("Play");
```
In order to make your program do something when the button is clicked, you attach a _listener_ to it:
```java
playButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
        playSound();
    } 
});
```

- the JButton is the **event source**;
- its **events** are button presses;
- the **listener** is the anonymous ActionListener instance 
- the **function** called when the event happens is actionPerformed

### First-class functions
#### Lambda expressions
you can only use a lambda when the Java compiler can verify two things:
```java
new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
}).start();
```
1. It must be able to determine the **type** of the functional object the lambda will create. In this example, the compiler sees that the `Thread` constructor takes a `Runnable`, so it will infer that the type must be `Runnable`.
2. This inferred type must be a _functional interface_: an interface with **only one (abstract) method**. In this example, `Runnable` indeed only has a single method — `void run()` — so the compiler knows the code in the body of the lambda belongs in the body of a `run` method of a new `Runnable` object.
