### Strategy 1: confinement
- Neither reassigning them in the `Runnable` nor reading them in the `Runnable` when they are **reassigned outside** it are allowed
- 在 Java 中，实例变量可以自由地在匿名内部类中被访问和修改，因为实例变量属于包含它的对象实例，而这个对象实例本身在匿名内部类中是通过引用传递的。

### Strategy 2: immutability

### Strategy 3: using threadsafe data types

#### Good safety arguments
```java
/** Team is a mutable data type representing a team of people. */
public class Team {
    private final Set<String> people = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
    // Rep invariant:
    //    true
    // Abstraction function:
    //    AF(people) = the group of people whose names are in the set `people` 
    // Thread safety argument:
    //    people is a threadsafe set, and the people variable is unreassignable.
```

#### Bad safety arguments
```java
public class Graph {
    private final Set<Node> nodes =
                   Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
    private final Map<Node,Set<Node>> edges =
                   Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
    // Rep invariant:
    //    for all x, y such that y is a member of edges.get(x),
    //        x, y are both members of nodes
    // Abstraction function:
    //    represents a directed graph whose nodes are the set of nodes
    //        and whose edges are the set (x,y) such that
    //                         y is a member of edges.get(x)
    // Thread safety argument:
    //    - nodes and edges are final, so those variables are immutable
    //      and threadsafe
    //    - nodes and edges point to threadsafe set and map data types
```
Just using threadsafe-immutable and threadsafe-mutable data types is not sufficient when the rep invariant depends on relationships <font color="#ff0000">_between_ objects</font> in the rep.
```java
public void addEdge(Node from, Node to) {
    if ( ! edges.containsKey(from)) {
        edges.put(from, Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>()));
    }
    edges.get(from).add(to);
    nodes.add(from);
    nodes.add(to);
}
```

This code has **race conditions**. There is a crucial moment when the rep invariant is violated, right after the `edges` map is mutated, but just before the `nodes` set is mutated. Another operation on the graph might interleave at that moment, discover the rep invariant broken, and return wrong results.

#### Serializability
**可序列化性**（Serializability）是并发控制的一种概念，它确保并发执行的事务在某个顺序上是可序列化的，即这些事务在某个顺序上（某个顺序的串行执行）等价于某个串行执行结果。
