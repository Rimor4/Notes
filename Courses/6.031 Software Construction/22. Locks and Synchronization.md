### Deadlock
 **Deadlock** occurs when concurrent modules are stuck <span style="background:#b1ffff">waiting for each other</span> to do something
### Developing a threadsafe abstract data type
#### Steps to develop the datatype
1. **Specify.** Define the operations (method signatures and specs). We did that in the `EditBuffer` interface.
    
2. **Test.** Develop test cases for the operations. See [`EditBufferTest`](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/22-locks/code.html#editbuffertestjava) in the provided code. The test suite includes a testing strategy based on partitioning the parameter space of the operations.
    
3. **Rep.** Choose a rep. We chose two of them for `EditBuffer`, and this is often a good idea:
    
    1. **Implement a simple, brute-force rep first.** It’s easier to write, you’re more likely to get it right, and it will validate your test cases and your specification so you can fix problems in them before you move on to the harder implementation. This is why we implemented `SimpleBuffer` before moving on to `GapBuffer`. Don’t throw away your simple version, either — keep it around so that you have something to test and compare against in case things go wrong with the more complex one.
        
    2. **Write down the rep invariant and abstraction function, and implement `checkRep()`.** `checkRep()` asserts the rep invariant at the end of every constructor, producer, and mutator method. (It’s typically not necessary to call it at the end of an observer, since the rep hasn’t changed.) In fact, assertions can be very useful for testing complex implementations, so it’s not a bad idea to also assert the postcondition at the end of a complex method. You’ll see an example of this in `GapBuffer.moveGap()` in the code with this reading.

4. **Synchronize.** Make an argument that your rep is threadsafe. Write it down explicitly as a comment in your class, right by the rep invariant, so that a maintainer knows how you designed thread safety into the class.

5. **Iterate**. You may find that your choice of operations makes it hard to write a threadsafe type with the guarantees clients require. You might discover this in step 1, or in step 2 when you write tests, or in steps 3 or 4 when you implement. If that’s the case, go back and refine the set of operations your ADT provides.
### Monitor pattern  
-   
    The _monitor pattern_ guards the rep of a datatype with a single lock that is acquired by every method.
Java provides some syntactic sugar that helps with the monitor pattern. If you add the keyword `synchronized` to a **method signature**, then Java will act as if you wrote `synchronized (this)` around the method body. So the code below is an equivalent way to implement the synchronized `SimpleBuffer`:
```java
public synchronized void insert(int position, String insertion) {
	text = text.substring(0, position) + insertion + text.substring(position);
	checkRep();
}
```
#### Synchronized Statements
Another way to create synchronized code is with _synchronized statements_. Unlike synchronized methods, synchronized statements must specify the object that provides the intrinsic lock:
```java
public void addName(String name) {
    synchronized(this) {
        lastName = name;
        nameCount++;
    }
    nameList.add(name);
}
```
通过使用**细粒度同步技术**，可以在保证线程安全的同时，显著提高程序的并发性。
```java
public class MsLunch {
    private long c1 = 0;
    private long c2 = 0;
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();  // 锁对象1，用于同步c1的更新操作
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();  // 锁对象2，用于同步c2的更新操作

    public void inc1() {
        synchronized(lock1) {  // 使用锁对象1来同步c1的更新操作
            c1++;
        }
    }

    public void inc2() {
        synchronized(lock2) {  // 使用锁对象2来同步c2的更新操作
            c2++;
        }
    }
}
```


**Acquiring a lock means one thing and one thing <font color="#ff0000">only</font>: no other thread can acquire that lock, until the lock is released.**
![[Pasted image 20240518202244.png]]

#### Nested synchronization
```java
synchronized (obj) {
    // ...
    synchronized (obj) { // <-- uh oh, deadlock?
        // ...
    }
    // <-- do we own the lock on obj?
}
```
Acquire and release come in pairs, and `synchronized` blocks on the same object can be **safely** nested inside each other.The thread continues to own it until each acquire has had its corresponding release, and the **counter** has fallen to zero.

### Thread safety argument with synchronization
#### Locking discipline
1. Every **shared mutable variable** must be guarded by some lock. The data may not be read or written except inside a synchronized block that acquires that lock.
2. If an invariant involves multiple shared mutable variables (which might even be in <span style="background:#b1ffff">different objects</span>), then all the variables involved must be guarded by the **_same_ lock**. Once a thread acquires the lock, the invariant must be reestablished before releasing the lock.

### Designing a datatype for concurrency
As another example, consider the [`ConcurrentMap`](http://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html) interface in Java. 
- `map.putIfAbsent(key,value)` is an atomic version of  
      `if ( ! map.containsKey(key)) map.put(key, value);`
- `map.replace(key, value)` is an atomic version of  
      `if (map.containsKey(key)) map.put(key, value);`
### Deadlock rears its ugly head
```java
    // thread A                   // thread B
    while (true) {                while (true) {
      harry.friend(snape);          snape.friend(harry);
      harry.defriend(snape);        snape.defriend(harry);
    }                             }
```
#### Deadlock solution 1: lock ordering
One way to prevent deadlock is to **put an ordering on the locks** that need to be acquired simultaneously, and ensuring that all code acquires the locks in that order.  (particularly in code like <span style="background:#b1ffff">operating system kernels</span>
（互斥信号量）
```java
    public void friend(Wizard that) {
        Wizard first, second;
        if (this.name.compareTo(that.name) < 0) {
            first = this; second = that;
        } else {
            first = that; second = this;
        }
        synchronized (first) {
            synchronized (second) {
                if (friends.add(that)) {
                    that.friend(this);
                } 
            }
        }
    }
```
drawback: 
1. **not modular**;  
2. Difficult to Know Which Locks Are Needed
#### Deadlock solution 2: coarse-grained locking
 (particularly for <span style="background:#b1ffff">application programming</span>
 ```java
public class Wizard {
    private final Castle castle;
    private final String name;
    private final Set<Wizard> friends;
    ...
    public void friend(Wizard that) {
        synchronized (castle) {
            if (this.friends.add(that)) {
                that.friend(this);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
drawback: **performance penalty**
